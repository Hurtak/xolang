## TODO

- https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler/blob/master/the-super-tiny-compiler.js
- ast
    - cleanup walk functions - so the do not use global state that much
    - fully type compile function
    - fix TS errors
- compiler stuff
    - transformation
    - js code generation

- Prefixing interfaces with "I", is this common practice or should we disable this in TSLint?
